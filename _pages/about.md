I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo, Department of Applied Mathematics under the supervision of Professor [Jun Liu](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/people-profiles/jun-liu). My research interests span Diffusion Models, Control Theory, and Partial Differential Equations.

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Research intern at [RBC Borealis](https://rbcborealis.com/research/), where I worked to advance the application of diffusion models for prediction in irregularly sampled time series under the presence of mixed data types and variable sequence length.

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Mathematics with Scientific Computing and a Minor in Statistics from the University of Waterloo in 2022.

Some fun facts about me. Prior to my undergraduate degree, I was born in Japan and lived there for 18 years. I am also learning Mandarin in my spare time.

Aside from doing math, you will often see me playing board games or enjoying an order of bubble tea. 

Will be happy to connect with like-minded enthusiasts in mathematics and AI. You can reach me at: a29mukhe [at] uwaterloo [dot] ca
