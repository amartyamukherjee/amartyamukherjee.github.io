I am a first year PhD student in the University of Waterloo, Department of Applied Mathematics under the supervision of Professor Jun Liu. The focus of my research is in Reinforcement Learning, Control Theory, and Partial Differential Equations. 

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Mathematics with Scientific Computing and a Minor in Statistics from the University of Waterloo in 2022. Prior to that, I was born in Japan and lived there for 18 years.

Aside from doing math, you will often see me playing board games or enjoying an order of bubble tea.
