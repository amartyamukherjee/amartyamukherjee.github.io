I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo, Department of Applied Mathematics under the supervision of Professor [Jun Liu](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/people-profiles/jun-liu). My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning, Control Theory, and Partial Differential Equations.

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Mathematics with Scientific Computing and a Minor in Statistics from the University of Waterloo in 2022. Prior to that, I was born in Japan and lived there for 18 years.

Aside from doing math, you will often see me playing board games or enjoying an order of bubble tea.
