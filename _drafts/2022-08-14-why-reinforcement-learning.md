My first exposure to reinforcement learning began over a year before I started applying for graduate school programs. I enrolled in the AMATH 455 (Control Theory) class taught by my now supervisor. As part of that course, we had to write four lab reports related to the course content. I requested to opt out of one of the lab reports and write a report about machine learning instead, which the instructor was also enthusiastic about.

Upon exploring areas where machine learning and control theory intersect, I came across a branch of machine learning where models learn through a trial-and-error process from interacting with a given environment. As you may have guessed, this is exactly what reinforcement learning is.

I used Q-Learning to solve a control problem that I was exposed to during a past lab report. This report ended up becoming [this paper](/publication/2021-05-25-Q-Learning-Cart-Position/).

I found reinforcement learning a perfect combination of machine learning and physics
