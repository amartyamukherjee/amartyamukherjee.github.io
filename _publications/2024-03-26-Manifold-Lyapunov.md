excerpt: 'The core objective of our proposed method is to develop stabilizing control functions by identifying the closest asymptotically stable vector field relative to a predetermined manifold and adjusting the control function based on this finding. To achieve this, we employ a diffusion model trained on pairs consisting of asymptotically stable vector
fields and their corresponding Lyapunov functions. Our numerical results demonstrate that this pre-trained model can
achieve stabilization over previously unseen systems efficiently and rapidly, showcasing the potential of our approach
in fast zero-shot control and generalizability.'

This paper presents a novel approach to generating stabilizing controllers for a large class of dynamical systems
using diffusion models. The core objective is to develop stabilizing control functions by identifying the closest
asymptotically stable vector field relative to a predetermined manifold and adjusting the control function based on
this finding. To achieve this, we employ a diffusion model trained on pairs consisting of asymptotically stable vector
fields and their corresponding Lyapunov functions. Our numerical results demonstrate that this pre-trained model can
achieve stabilization over previously unseen systems efficiently and rapidly, showcasing the potential of our approach
in fast zero-shot control and generalizability.
