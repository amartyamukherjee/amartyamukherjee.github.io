Diffusion models have emerged as a promising class of generative models that map noisy inputs to realistic images.
More recently, they have been employed to generate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, they still struggle to solve inverse problems in PDEs such as the Poisson equation because the eigenvalues that are large in magnitude amplify the measurement noise.
This paper presents a novel approach for the inverse solution of PDEs through the use of denoising diffusion restoration models (DDRM).
DDRMs were used in linear inverse problems to restore original clean signals by exploiting the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the linear operator.
Equivalently, we present an approach to restore the original parameters in PDEs by exploiting the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator.
Our results show that using denoising diffusion restoration significantly improves the estimation of the parameters.
